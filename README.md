# Personal Website
This is my website with my contact information and résumé as well as work and volunteer experience. 

## Inspiration
I created this website as a digital portfolio of my coding experience. It demonstrates my knowledge in HTML/CSS as well as displays photos and descriptions of my extracurriculars, leadership roles, and coding projects. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This website has a variety of interesting features, including a fixed image that does not scroll with the webpage and the ability to change the background colour with JavaScript. Hovering over my name, links to my social media, and photos produces different effects.

## What I learned
I was able to learn much more about HTML, CSS, and web design. Designing the website also helped me discover my passion for graphic design. 

## What's next for this website
This website is a work in progress so it is always changing!
